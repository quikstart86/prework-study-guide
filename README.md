# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide stands as an account in getting off the ground with a front end web dev course. Covering a lot including SHH, Git, GitHub, Gitlab, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a professional README page.

- The motivation is to become a great web developer. To be self-sufficient, providing great work and solutions for clients. I'd also like to find some great partners on the journey to collaborate with and develop our skills together, with a potential goal to set up my own company in the future.
- Why do this? To start to understand the building blocks to web development and coding.
- The problem it is currently solving is the one of me starting to learn WD as it has always been a goal.
- We learned how to install Git Bash/Homebrew/Xcode to use as our CLI. We created SSH keys to link to our cloud repos on GitHub and GitLab. We installed an IDE called Visual Studio Code to help us get to grips with coding. We integrated 'open in browser' plugin in VScode to see our work develop immediately. We created a Repo 'Prework Study Guide' / Licence file/ ReadMe file / CSS file / HTML file / JavaScript file. We learned how to <link> the files to the index.html file to read. We learned about Chrome Dev tools and how to see JS lines on a browser.
